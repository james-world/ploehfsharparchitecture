My run through of Mark Seeman's FSharp Architecture Pluralsight Course

There are some tags you might find useful:

EndOfModule3 - where Mark branches to do file based and azure based persistence.
FilePersistence - with file based persistence
AzurePersistence - with azure persistence - this will work against the Azure Storage Emulator and you can also publish the project to Azure as well.
